## Blockchain

**To The Moon**

```
This person has been storing messages on the blockchain with Bitcoin, but we 
can't even find their wallet address. All we found was a grumpy cat picture. 
Find the wallet address to find the flag{}.
```

**Bad Blockchain**

```
This new botnet is using blockchain to store backup command-and-control server 
IP addresses. We’ve extracted the Bitcoin address but it’s not using the 
traditional OP_RETURN to hide the data. Can you find the IP address?
```


## Image

**Hit a brick wall**

```
The spare key is usually under the doormat, a plant pot, or a rock…
```

**Turtles all the way down**

```
Just an archive of happy turtle pictures.
```

## Text

**Sequence**

```
The director of this company believes 2 of his employees are sending secret 
messages using some sort of mathematical code, but the messages seem to be 
on-topic.
```


## Network/Data

**Intercepted**

```
This email was intercepted from a compromised webserver. We believe criminals 
were using it to send secret messages but the message body is vague and does 
not use PGP encryption.
```

**Hidden**

```
Found in the system32 directory, this .dll file doesn’t do what it says.
```

## Audio/Video

**Elliot’s secret stash** 

```
Free stuff is good, but you could be storing something sinister without your 
consent.
```
